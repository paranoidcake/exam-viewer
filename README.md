# exam-viewer

Web server to provide various views of Leaving Certificate exam papers and marking schemes.

Uncomment and run `lib::scraper::scrape_exams()` once, which should begin downloading the exam papers/marking scheme pdfs.
It is currently a fairly simple web scraper and will be replaced some day for reliability.
